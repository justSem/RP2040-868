# RP2040-868 Case


__Revision:__ 1.0-TESTING


__CAUTION__: This is a _testing_ release. The case itself is still underway from the manufacturer - but it __should__ fit.


This 3d-printable case perfectly fits your board, and is additionally capable of holding a Triple-18650 Battery Pack. - I used [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5035) one as an example.


## On assembly

The screwholes on the side are made for standard M3 screws.
The holding pins in the bottom of the case are meant to hold M3 threaded inserts.
